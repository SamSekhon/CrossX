10 EXAMINATION BY
11 MS. McCAWLEY:
12 Q. Good morning. I'm going to explain
13 some of the rules that will happen with
14 respect to depositions.
15 Have you ever been deposed before?
16 A. I have not.
17 Q. What is going to happen here, we
18 have a court reporter and a videographer.
19 What they do is take down the words that we
20 say so when I ask you a question they will
21 record what you say in response to that. So
22 we have to be mindful that in order for them
23 to do their job we can't talk over each
24 other.
25 Another issue you have to be weary

2 of is that in a response, you can't give a
3 nonverbal response, in other words, nodding a
4 yes or no, they need to hear verbal response
5 so they can record it on their transcript.
6 So that's important for you to remember as we
7 go through the day. If you forget, I will be
8 sure to remind you.
9 Is there anything that would
10 prevent you from giving truthful testimony
11 today?
12 A. There is not.
13 Q. You are not on any medications or
14 anything that would inhibit your ability to
15 remember or give truthful testimony?
16 A. I am not.
17 MR. PAGLIUCA: Could you identify
18 the assistant in the room.
19 MS. McCAWLEY: This is Emma Rosen
20 from our New York office. She is a
21 paralegal.
22 Q. Ms. Maxwell, can you please state
23 your address for the record?
24 A. Currently
25 Q. What is your date of birth?

3 Q. When did you first recruit a female
4 to work for Mr. Epstein?
5 MR. PAGLIUCA: I object to the form
6 and foundation of the question. I
7 believe this is confidential
8 information. I ask anyone who is not
9 admitted in this case be excused from
10 the room, please.
11 MS. McCAWLEY: So the response to
12 that question would -—-
13 MR. PAGLIUCA: The subject matter
14 of this question is confidential and I'm
15 designating it as confidential.
16 MS. McCAWLEY: I just want to make
17 that clear for the record.
18 MR. EDWARDS: So we don't delay the
19 deposition I will step out of the room
20 but I think it's important to lay the
21 record that --
22 MR. PAGLIUCA: I'm sorry, you are
23 not admitted in this proceeding so you
24 are not entitled to make any record. If
25 Ms. McCawley wants to make a record she

2 can.
3 MR. EDWARDS: I can make a record
4 right now.
5 MR. PAGLIUCA: Maybe we should get
6 the judge on the phone and talk about
7 it.
8 MR. EDWARDS: The record will be
9 short. This is the precise reason why
10 Ms. Giuffre wants me in this case and
11 I'm unable to effectively represent her
12 at this time because I am unable to have
13 access to the confidential information
14 which includes apparently the entire
15 deposition of Ms. Maxwell. But for the
16 sake of not further delaying this, I
17 will be outside the room.
18 MS. McCAWLEY: Thank you.
19 A. I would like to just -- wait for
20 him to leave.
21 Q. That's fine.
22 A. I would just like to clarify the
23 address. I'm in the process of selling the
24 house so while while I still receive mail
25 there, it's not my actual physical address.

2 It's in the process of being sold. It still
3 requires some final paperwork to be done, so
4 just for the purposes of clarity.
5 Q. Do you have a new address where you
6 will be living?
7 A. I do not.
8 Q. For the purpose of the record, if
9 there is something I ask you that you later
10 remember something else or need to correct
11 your testimony in some way, you can do that,
12 just let me know what it is and we will go
13 back to that question and can you clarify.
14 A. Of course. I just wanted to be
15 clear, there is still some paperwork pending
16 for final release, but it's in the process of
17 sale. But I don't have another address
18 currently, so whilst that should still be of
19 record that the mail could be forwarded
20 there, so for purposes of clarity I wanted to
21 be clear.
22 Q. I appreciate that.
23 So Ms. Maxwell, when did you first
24 recruit a female to work for Mr. Epstein?

2 form and foundation of the question.
3 Q. You can answer the question.
4 A. First of all, can you please
5 clarify the question. I don't understand
6 what you mean by female, I don't understand
7 what you mean by recruit. Please be more
8 clear and specific about what you are
9 suggesting.
10 Q. Are you a female, is that the sex
11 that you are?
12 A. I am a female.
13 Q. That's what I'm referring to a
14 female and I'm asking you when you first, the
15 very first time you recruited a female to
16 work for Mr. Epstein?
17 A. Again, I don't understand what
18 female -- I am a 54 year old women.
19 Q. I'm not making it age, any age of a
20 female that you recruited to work for Mr.
21 Epstein?

23 number of people to work for Mr. Epstein and
24 hiring is one of my functions.
