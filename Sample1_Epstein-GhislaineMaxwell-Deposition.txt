11 MS. McCAWLEY:
12 Q. Good morning. I'm going to explain
13 some of the rules that will happen with
14 respect to depositions.
15 Have you ever been deposed before?
16 A. I have not.
17 Q. What is going to happen here, we
18 have a court reporter and a videographer.
19 What they do is take down the words that we
20 say so when I ask you a question they will
21 record what you say in response to that. So
22 we have to be mindful that in order for them
23 to do their job we can't talk over each
24 other.
25 Another issue you have to be weary

2 of is that in a response, you can't give a
3 nonverbal response, in other words, nodding a
4 yes or no, they need to hear verbal response
5 so they can record it on their transcript.
6 So that's important for you to remember as we
7 go through the day. If you forget, I will be
8 sure to remind you.
9 Is there anything that would
10 prevent you from giving truthful testimony
11 today?
12 A. There is not.
13 Q. You are not on any medications or
14 anything that would inhibit your ability to
15 remember or give truthful testimony?
16 A. I am not.
17 MR. PAGLIUCA: Could you identify
18 the assistant in the room.
19 MS. McCAWLEY: This is Emma Rosen
20 from our New York office. She is a
21 paralegal.
22 Q. Ms. Maxwell, can you please state

4 to work for Mr. Epstein?
5 MR. PAGLIUCA: I object to the form

3 MR. EDWARDS: I can make a record
4 right now.
5 MR. PAGLIUCA: Maybe we should get
6 the judge on the phone and talk about
7 it.
8 MR. EDWARDS: The record will be
9 short. This is the precise reason why
10 Ms. Giuffre wants me in this case and
11 I'm unable to effectively represent her
12 at this time because I am unable to have
13 access to the confidential information
14 which includes apparently the entire
15 deposition of Ms. Maxwell. But for the
16 sake of not further delaying this, I
17 will be outside the room.
18 MS. McCAWLEY: Thank you.
19 A. I would like to just -- wait for
20 him to leave.
21 Q. That's fine.
22 A. I would just like to clarify the
23 address. I'm in the process of selling the
24 house so while while I still receive mail
25 there, it's not my actual physical address.

3 requires some final paperwork to be done, so
4 just for the purposes of clarity.
5 Q. Do you have a new address where you
6 will be living?
7 A. I do not.
8 Q. For the purpose of the record, if
9 there is something I ask you that you later
10 remember something else or need to correct
11 your testimony in some way, you can do that,
12 just let me know what it is and we will go
13 back to that question and can you clarify.
14 A. Of course. I just wanted to be
15 clear, there is still some paperwork pending
16 for final release, but it's in the process of
17 sale. But I don't have another address
18 currently, so whilst that should still be of
19 record that the mail could be forwarded
20 there, so for purposes of clarity I wanted to
21 be clear.

3 Q. You can answer the question.
4 A. First of all, can you please
5 clarify the question. I don't understand
6 what you mean by female, I don't understand
7 what you mean by recruit. Please be more
8 clear and specific about what you are
9 suggesting.
10 Q. Are you a female, is that the sex
11 that you are?
12 A. I am a female.
13 Q. That's what I'm referring to a
14 female and I'm asking you when you first, the
15 very first time you recruited a female to
16 work for Mr. Epstein?
17 A. Again, I don't understand what
18 female -- I am a 54 year old women.
19 Q. I'm not making it age, any age of a
20 female that you recruited to work for Mr.
21 Epstein?
22 A. Again, I was somebody who hired a
23 number of people to work for Mr. Epstein and

2 hired someone to work for Mr. Epstein, a
3 female?
4 A. As best as I can recollect, a woman
5 the age probably of about 40 or 50 was in
6 sometime in 1992.
7 Q. How long did you work for Mr.
8 Epstein?
9 A. I started working for him at some
10 point in 1992 and the nature of my work
11 relationship with him changed over time so
12 from around 2002, 2003, the work lessened
13 considerably.
14 Q. When did you --

16 a moment. If we are talking about
17 background --
18 MS. McCAWLEY: I'm in the middle of
19 a question. Let me finish it and then
20 can you interject.
21 Q. When you say 2002 to 2003 that the
22 work lessened, when did you complete working
23 for Mr. Epstein; when was the last time you
24 were employed by him, the last date?

2 helping him in a very nominal way, maybe an
3 hour or two a year at sometime 2008 and 2009.
4 MR. PAGLIUCA: So if you are going
5 to be talking about general background,
6 I don't need to designate that as
7 confidential. So if you want to have
8 them come back in, that's fine.
9 I assumed by your first question
10 you were going into more sensitive
11 areas. I will leave it up to you, but
12 if this is general background it will
13 not be designated as confidential.
14 MS. McCAWLEY: I appreciate that.
15 I will jump back into my other
16 questions.
17 MR. PAGLIUCA: So we will keep it
18 as confidential.
19 Q. When you were first employed by him
20 in 1992, what were you hired to do?
21 A. First, I was consulting and what I
22 did was I helped with decorating houses and
23 in hiring staff to help run those houses.
24 Q. Did your duties change over the
25 course of 1992 to 2009?

2 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form
3 and foundation.
4 A. My job entailed running the homes
5 that he had but much more importantly, most
6 of the houses had construction and so whilst
7 in 1992 there was no construction project,
8 there was construction projects that began
9 after that time and I was in charge not only
10 of hiring architects, I was also in charge of
11 all the filings or overseeing that, like a
12 general contractor would.
13 I also helped with hiring the
14 architects, hiring the builders, reviewing
15 the contracts for the builders, coordinating
16 the building projects, coordinating how the
17 projects would layout, the timing of the
18 projects and all the various materials that
19 they would require to run a very substantial
20 building project. That's the nature of the
21 job I was dealing with.

5 Jeffrey.

7 you ever hire someone that was under the age

19 A. I have a number of friends that
20 have children and friends of mine that have
21 kids and in the invitation of my friends and

3 A. Again, there would be no course to
4 have a conversation with Virginia unless she
5 held herself out to be a masseuse.

7 asking if you invited her to come to Jeffrey
8 Epstein's home when she was under the age of
9 18?

11 and in the form and as my job, I was to have

13 including massage. She came as a masseuse.

2 you not to answer that question. I
3 don't have any problem with you asking

5 of this lawsuit is, which would be, as

7 Ms. Roberts.
8 To the extent you are asking for

9 and another female?

2 Q. I'm not talking about friends. I'm
3 talking about individuals --
4 MR. PAGLIUCA: I'm going to object
5 to you interrupting the witness who was
6 answering your question. The question
7 was, have you ever seen anyone, female
8 under the age of 18 at the house and
9 that's the question she was answering.
10 If you want to strike that question and
11 ask another question, feel free, but let
12 the witness respond, please.
13 MS. McCAWLEY: I will do that.
14 Q. Have you ever observed a female
15 under the age of 18 at Jeffrey Epstein's home
16 that was not a friend, a child -- one of your
17 friend's children?
18 A. Again, I can't testify to that
19 because I have no idea what you are talking
20 about.
21 Q. You have no idea what I'm talking
22 about in the sense you never observed a
23 female under the age of 18 at Jeffrey
24 Epstein's home that was not one of your
25 friend's children, is that correct?

4 A. How would I possibly know how
5 someone is when they are at his house. You
6 are asking me to do that. I cannot possibly
7 testify to that. As far as I'm concerned,
8 everyone who came to his house was an adult
9 professional person.
10 Q. Are you familiar with the police
11 report that was issued in respect to the
12 investigation in this matter?

15 Q. Are you familiar with the police

17 investigation of Jeffrey Epstein, has been
18 produced as a document in this matter?
19 A. I have seen a police report.
20 (Maxwell Exhibit 1, police report,
21 marked for identification.)
22 Q. The police report that you have in
23 front of you, can you turn to page 28 of that
24 report, the numbers are on the top right-hand

2 You will see some redactions in
3 this report, Ms. Maxwell, the redacted
4 information is redacted because it reveals
5 the name of a minor, someone who is under the
6 age of 18.
7 On page 28, in the third paragraph,
8 about halfway down, it says, J) stated
9 she performed the massage naked. At the
10 conclusion of this massage, Epstein paid
11 (QB) $200 for the massage. He explained, I
12 know you are not comfortable put I will pay
13 you if you bring some girls. He told her the
14 younger the better. [RR stated once tried
15 to bring a 23 year old to Epstein and he
16 stated the female was too old.
17 Have you heard Mr. Epstein use the
18 phrase the younger the better?
19 A. I have no recollection of hearing
20 that.
21 Q. Have you used the phrase in talking
22 to MJ anc asking her to recruit
23 females for Mr. Epstein, the younger the
24 better?

2 and foundation of the question.
3 A. First of all, can you break the
4 question apart.
5 Q. Have you used the phrase the
6 younger the better in speaking to [J
7 and asking her to recruit females for Jeffrey
8 Epstein?
9 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form

11 Q. You can answer. It's yes or no.
12 A. No, that's absolutely not true, on
13 the second part of your question, I have not
14 asked Virginia to recruit females and the
15 first part of your question, if you can
16 repeat that again, the question you asked.
17 Q. Will you read back the question.
18 (Record read.)
19 A. I believe I answered the later part
20 of the question. The first part of the
21 question, it's impossible for me to recall
22 events that took place 16 years ago but it
23 doesn't sound like something I would say.
24 Q. On page 28, that same paragraph,
25 [ERR wes asked how many girls in total she

2 brought to Epstein. [RR stated that she
3 can remember, JR stated that she brought
4 and, it's redacted there, and the victim in
5 this case.
6 Let me ask my question, I have a
7 question pending right now.
8 Are you testifying that you are
9 unaware of any underage, under the age of 18,
10 females coming to Jeffrey Epstein's home to
11 perform massages?
12 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form
13 foundation.
14 A. You need to straddle that question
15 in a different time period. When I was
16 there, at the time I was present, the people
17 that gave Jeffrey, men and women who gave
18 Jeffrey massages were adults over the age of
19 18.
20 Q. Never in your time at any of
21 Jeffrey Epstein's homes were you present when
22 a female under the age of 18 was there to
23 give Jeffrey Epstein a massage?
24 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form

2 A. First of all, as I said when I was
3 present --
4 Q. It is a yes or no.
5 A. No, it is not.
6 Q. You can answer the question in full
7 but please provide yes or no as an initial
8 matter.
9 A. I cannot answer yes or no, it's not
10 bounded by time. It's entirely possible I
11 could have been in a room or even in the
12 vicinity of Palm beach when somebody came and
13 I would not know. How would I know when
14 somebody was in the house. There is no way I
15 can know.
16 Q. Did you stay at Jeffrey Epstein's
17 home when you were in Palm Beach?
18 A. Most of the time.
19 Q. So how is it that you wouldn't know
20 if there was a female in the home under the
21 age of 18 if you were staying there?
22 A. Well, first of all, when I was
23 staying there, the house is actually quite
24 large and I have a very busy job and I had an
25 office with a door so the door would be shut

2 and I would be working. I'm not responsible
3 for what Jeffrey does and I don't always pay
4 attention to what happens in the house. I'm
5 very busy.
6 Q. So you're testifying that you never
7 observed a female under the age of 18 at
8 Jeffrey Epstein's West Palm Beach home?
9 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form
10 and foundation.
11 A. I already answered that question, I
12 believe.
13 Q. You didn't answer my question.
14 A. I did.
15 Q. Did you observe a female under the
16 age of 18 at Jeffrey Epstein's home in Palm
17 Beach?
18 A. Like I said, I work, I don't sit
19 there and watch people coming in and out of
20 the house. I cannot possibly tell you if I'm
21 in the home that somebody was there that I
22 did not see, I cannot comment on it, I have
23 no idea.
24 Q. Did you observe females at Jeffrey
25 Epstein's home that were laying out topless

2 in the back of the home, in other words
3 without a shirt on?
4 A. So that's just another of
5 Virginia's lies. So let's be clear, at the
6 time when I was there and present, frequently
7 at the house, it was unusual to see people
8 without their clothes on.
9 Q. When you say unusual, did you
10 observe people without their clothes at
11 Jeffrey Espstein's home?
12 A. Can I answer. Sometimes people in
13 the privacy of a house and swimming pool, I
14 have seen people from time to time take their
15 top off. I have seen people from time to
16 time do that. Very unusual. Naked people
17 around the people at any frequent period of
18 time, I have never seen.
19 Q. Were they under the age of 18?
20 A. As I was saying, people when I was
21 in the house, were of adult age, if they were
22 children, friends of my family or friends
23 that were there, they may well have been
24 because I have nieces and nephews under the
25 age of 18, I cannot testify to anybody else

2 -- just another one of Virginia's many

3 fictitious lies and stories to make this a

4 salacious event to get interest and press.

5 It's absolute rubbish.

6 Q. Were you in charge of hiring

7 individuals to provide massages for Jeffrey

8 Epstein?

9 A. My job included hiring many people.
10 There were six homes. As I sit here, I hired
11 assistants, I hired architects, I hired
12 decorators, I hired cooks, I hired cleaners,
13 I hired gardeners, I hired pool people, I
14 hired pilots, I hired all sorts of people.

15 In the course and a very small part
16 of my job was from from time to time to find
17 adult professional massage therapists for
18 Jeffrey.
19 Q. When you say adult professional
20 massage therapists, where did you find these
21 massage therapists?
22 A. From time to time I would visit
23 professional spas, I would receive a massage
24 and if the massage was good I would ask that
25 man or woman if they did home visits.

2 Q. Did you ever hire a masseuse that
3 was under the age of 18?
4 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form
5 and foundation.
6 Q. Did you?
7 A. Again, I don't hire massage
8 therapists, so that was not my job.
9 Q. You just said you did, you just
10 said you hired massage therapists for Jeffrey
11 Epstein, I'm asking if you hired a massage
12 therapist who was under the age of 18?
13 A. Let me correct myself. When I
14 meant hire, I didn't mean hire in the way you
15 are doing it. What I say is that I went to
16 spas and I met people and if they did home
17 visits, Jeffrey would then, in fact, hire
18 them. I'm not responsible for hiring
19 someone. And they were not full-time, so
20 it's not a correct characterization.
21 Q. Did you ever, your term is meet,
22 did you ever meet a person that was under the
23 age of 18 that you -- that Jeffrey then hired
24 as a masseuse?

2 and foundation.

3 A. First of all, Virginia Roberts who

4 you are referring to was a masseuse aged 17,

5 we all now know, so your story that you keep

6 pushing out to the press that she was a 15

7 year old -- you and I both know was a lie,

8 correct.

9 Q. You are not sentencing my question.
10 A. You and I both know that was a lie,
11 correct.

12 Q. You are not answering my question.
13 I'm asking you whether you ever met a female
14 under the age of 18 that Jeffrey then hired
15 as a masseuse?
16 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form
17 and foundation.
18 A. The only person I can talk about
19 who clearly was a massage age 17, a masseuse,
20 was Virginia.
21 Q. Did you meet her and then introduce
22 her to Jeffrey?
23 A. I don't know. I already testified
24 I don't recall meeting her.

3 Q. So I'm showing you a document that
4 we have marked as Maxwell Exhibit 2. It's a

18 tomorrow and what ever it is will be
19 factually accurate.
20 Do you see that on page 1?
21 A. I do.

14 were you saying?
15 Q. 2011.
16 A. So by 2011, Ms. Roberts had already
17 perpetrated so many lies and stories it's
18 hard for me to accurately tell you today what
19 I remember back then. As I sit here today,
20 the testimony I give you today, I do not
21 recollect it.
22 Q. Do you have a reason to say that
23 this document that you wrote is incorrect?

25 you what I remember in 2011.

7 rubbish that you guys have put out in the
8 press that I read, maybe in the moment I
9 wrote it a memory came to me that I don't

3 Q. Did you ever participate in sex
4 with Virginia Roberts and Jeffrey Epstein?
5 A. I never ever at any single time at
6 any point ever at all participated in
7 anything with Virginia and Jeffrey. And for
8 the record, she is an absolute total liar and
9 you all know she lied on multiple things and
10 that is just one other disgusting thing she

2 over to the house in Palm Beach to give
3 massages?
4 A. It's important to understand that I
5 wasn't with Jeffrey all the time. In fact, I
6 was only in the house less than half the
7 time, so I cannot testify to when I wasn't in
8 the house how often she came when I wasn't
9 there.
10 What I can say is that I barely
11 would remember her, if not for all of this
12 rubbish, I probably wouldn't remember her at
13 all, except she did come from time to time
14 but I don't recollect her coming as often as
15 she portrayed herself.
16 Q. How many times a day on an average
17 day would Jeffrey Epstein get a massage?
18 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the

22 average, about once a day.

14 lies. I can testify to having read these
15 reports. I cannot testify to anything else
16 about them.
17 Q. So your testimony is that during
18 the time you were working there, you did not
19 know that these minor children were being
20 abused in the home while you were there?
21 A. What I have already told you and I
22 will repeat, I was in the house very limited
23 times, very few times. I do not know what
24 you are referring to. I've read these
25 reports but based on the lies that Virginia

4 Q. You said you were in the home a
5 very limited time, so average in the year for
6 example, 2004, how many times would you have
7 been in his Palm Beach home?
8 A. Very hard for me to state but very
9 little.
10 Q. How about his New York home?
11 A. Same.
12 Q. Were you his girlfriend in that
13 year, in 2004?
14 A. Define what you mean by girlfriend.
15 Q. Were you in a relationship with him
16 where you would consider yourself his
17 girlfriend?
18 A. No.
19 Q. Did you ever consider yourself his
20 girlfriend?
21 A. That's a tricky question. There
22 were times when I would have liked to think
23 of myself as his girlfriend.
24 Q. When would that have been?
25 A. Probably in the early '90s.

2 Q. In your responsibilities in working
3 for Jeffrey, would you book massages for him
4 on any given day so that he would have a
5 massage scheduled? Would you take a call for
6 example and book a massage for him?
7 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
8 form and foundation.
9 Q. You can answer.
10 A. Typically, that was not my
11 responsibility. He would either book the
12 massage himself or one of his other
13 assistants would do that.
14 Q. From time to time you had to do
15 that?
16 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the

8 recruiting other girls to perform sexual

20 me, I will not be trapped. You are asking me
21 if I recruit, I told you no. Girls meaning
22 underage, I already said I don't do that with

3 conversation or language that I used with
4 anybody at any time.
5 Q. Have you ever said to anybody that
6 you recruit other females over the age of 18
7 to take the pressure off you to having to
8 have sex with Jeffrey?

3 Q. So you won't testify to anything
4 I'm asking you 17 years ago about a statement
5 you made. How do you know it's 17 years ago?
6 A. We are talking about a time in
7 2000, right?
8 Q. Have you ever said that to anybody?
9 A. I'm 54 years old so you are asking
10 me in my entire life, what words are you
11 asking me in my entire life?

13 time you were with Jeffrey, this is the
14 question.
15 A. Let's time limit the question you
16 are asking me.
17 Q. So from, let's say, I think you
18 said you started with him in 1992, is that
19 correct, and finished with him in 2009.
20 So from 1992 to 2009 have you ever
21 said to anybody that you recruit other and we

2 A. First of all I resent and despise

3 the world recruit. Would you like to define

4 what you mean by recruit and by girls, you

5 mean underage people. I never had to do

6 anything with underage people. So why don't

7 you reask the question in a way that I am

13 A. I have no memory as I sit here

2 What I'm asking you is whether you
3 believe Jeffrey Epstein abused minors?
4 MR. PAGLIUCA: I object to the form
5 and you made your record, she answered
6 the question. A fair reading of her
7 answer is she doesn't have a belief
8 because she doesn't have any personal
9 knowledge.
10 MS. McCAWLEY: Now you are
11 testifying for the witness. Let her
12 answer the question.
13 MR. PAGLIUCA: It's a fair answer
14 to the question.
15 A. Again, I testified my only personal
16 knowledge concerns Virginia and everything
17 Virginia has said is an absolute lie, which
18 is why we are here in this room. If you are
19 asking me to testify about things I have no
20 knowledge of other than the police report
21 that you showed me, I am not in a position to
22 make a statement based on that because you
23 are asking me to speculate and I cannot
24 speculate.
25 Q. I'm asking you about your belief.

2 I'm not asking you to speculate at all. I'm
3 asking what you believe.

4 A. You are asking me to speculate and
5 I won't speculate.

6 Q. I'm not asking you to speculate.

7 I'm asking what you believe.

8 MR. PAGLIUCA: She answered the

9 question and we can move on.

10 MS. McCAWLEY: She hasn't answered
11 the question.

12 MR. PAGLIUCA: We are not going to
13 engage in this debate. She answered the
14 question. If you want to mark it and

15 move to compel an answer to the

16 question, have at it. Okay.

17 Q. Ms. Maxwell, is it your belief that
18 Jeffrey Epstein interacted sexually with

19 minors?
20 A. Again, you are asking me the same
21 type of question exactly but with different
22 language. Again, my only knowledge of
23 somebody who claims these things that I have
24 personal knowledge of is Virginia. Virginia
25 is an absolute liar and everything she has

2 said is a lie. Therefore, based on those
3 lies I cannot speculate on what anybody else
4 did or didn't do because if Virginia is the
5 example of what that story is and everything
6 she said is false, so everything that leads
7 from that is false.
8 Q. So the 30 other minor children in
9 the police report are also telling lies about
10 being sexually abused during massages with
11 Mr. Epstein?
12 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
13 form and foundation. Counsel, can you
14 show me in these police reports who the
15 30 minors are?
16 MS. McCAWLEY: I'm asking my
17 question.
18 MR. PAGLIUCA: You are making a
19 representation about numbers, you are
20 making a representation on the record
21 about what people said or didn't say.
22 We have no knowledge about that. These
23 are all redacted records so these are
24 bad questions. They don't lead to any
25 admissible evidence. It is only being

2 propounded to the witness to harass her.
3 So we are done with these questions.
4 MS. McCAWLEY: Are you done?
5 MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes.
6 Q. My question is, are you aware that
7 Jeffrey Epstein was convicted of having
8 relations with a minor child?
9 MR. PAGLIUCA: She answered that
10 question already.
11 MS. McCAWLEY: I'm getting to my
12 next question.

14 question. Don't keep asking the same
15 question.

17 shouting, I want the record to reflect
18 that you are interrupting the

20 take a deep breath and please let me ask

2 interacted sexually with minors?
3 A. Again, I go back to this, my only
4 actual knowledge is with Virginia and
5 Virginia is a liar, so I can only talk to
6 what Virginia's story and as I said before
7 and there are so many examples, I mean
8 thousands of examples of her lies, that that
9 is the only thing I can talk to.
10 Q. Based on that you do not believe
11 that Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused minors?
12 A. Again, as I said, I'm only talking
13 to what I know, I can only talk to Virginia.
14 Q. So is it your belief that Jeffrey
15 Epstein did not sexually abuse minors?
16 A. Again, I can only talk to what I
17 know and I know that Virginia is a liar and
18 that what she said is a lie. So I can only
19 testify to what she accused and you guys put
20 in the press for salacious purposes and
21 whatever terrible, inappropriate, unethical
22 and terrible reasons you chose to do that
23 about me and I can testify those are all
24 lies.

2 sexually abused any minor children?
3 A. Again, I only know 1000 percent
4 that Virginia is a liar. I can only talk to
5 Virginia, her lies and your inappropriate,
6 unethical, really unattractive, terrible use
7 of her and the way that you have abused the
8 system, used the press for purposes that are
9 unethical, inappropriate and appalling.
10 Q. Do you believe that Jeffrey Epstein
11 used massages to lure minors to have sex with
12 him?
13 A. Again, that is Virginia's
14 testimony, which is a lie.
15 Q. But do you believe that?
16 A. Again, I refer back to Virginia.
17 Q. I'm asking whether you believe it
18 or not?
19 A. I can only go with what I know and
20 I know Virginia is a liar and therefore
21 that's a lie.
22 Q. So you don't believe that?
23 A. I said, I only know that Virginia
24 is lying.

2 is a registered sex offender?
3 A. I am.
4 Q. Are you aware that Jeffrey Epstein
5 paid considerable amounts of money to settle
6 lawsuits with the minor children that he had
7 sexual contact with?
8 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
9 form and foundation.
10 A. I have no knowledge of those
11 issues.
12 Q. Why did you continue to maintain
13 contact with Jeffrey Epstein after he pled
14 guilty?
15 A. I'm a very loyal person and Jeffrey
16 was very good to me when my father passed
17 away and I believe that you need to be a good
18 friend in people's hour of need and I felt
19 that it was a very thoughtful, nice thing for
20 me to do to help in very limited fashion
21 which was helping if he had any issue with
22 his homes, in terms of the staffing issues.
23 It was very, very minor but I felt it was
24 thoughtful in somebody's hour of need.

6 Q. When you say a little, what you did
7 mean by that?
8 A. I don't recall exactly the amount.
9 Q. So in 2009 when you left him, what
10 were you being paid?

21 A. I just told you, it was under 500,
22 it was an amount of money less than $500,000,

2 Q. Did you have an attorney to consult
3 with during the criminal investigation of

4 Jeffrey Epstein?

5 A. I don't believe I did.

6 Q. When did you learn that a search

7 warrant was executed for the Palm Beach

8 house?

9 A. I don't recall exactly.

10 Q. Were you present at the house in

11 advance of the search warrant being executed?

14 A. I don't remember when the search

15 warrant was executed and I don't remember the
16 year that the search warrant was executed and
17 whenever that was, I already testified, I was
18 very, very infrequently at the house. So

19 highly unlikely but I was there a couple of
20 days, I just don't know which days it was in

3 if you needed to go online to get something,
4 that people could use.
5 Q. Was that on a desk that you would
6 use in your work capacity when you were at
7 the house?
8 A. It was a desk, it was a room I was,
9 I didn't really use that computer.
10 Q. Were there images of naked girls
11 whether they be under the age of 18 or over

2 or around the home?
3 A. I think we need to distinguish
4 between anyone under the age of 18 and over
5 the age of 18.
6 Q. We will start with, did you take
7 pictures of nude females in or around any of
8 Jeffrey's homes of women or females that were
9 under the age of 18?
10 A. No.
11 Q. Did you take pictures of nude

15 sort of nakedness to an individual.
16 In any of Jeffrey's homes, either
17 Palm Beach, New Mexico, USVI or New York
18 either outside by the pool, anywhere in or

2 in a mainstream magazine today, there would
3 be no inappropriateness, they would be
4 covered, concealed, you wouldn't see anything

6 The types of -- first, I took very
7 few and they were always by request, this was
8 a picture you could put on your -- gift to
9 your parent or to your grandparents to put on
10 their mantel piece . It would be a very

12 wouldn't see anything.
13 Q. Who would request those pictures?

15 women would ask to have nice photographs of
16 them taken.
17 Q. And did Jeffrey Epstein request
18 those pictures?
19 A. I don't ever recall him asking me
20 to take pictures.
21 Q. Did you give him pictures of naked
22 females as a present?

25 would constitute a gift.

3 Do you recall ever giving Jeffrey
4 Epstein pictures that you've taken of these
5 individuals in a naked state?

4 Roberts on her own without another individual
5 in it in a naked state?

7 picture of Virginia -- naked, we are not
8 referring to someone with no clothing on at
9 all, we are referring to someone that could
10 be semi clad or could have a towel or we are
11 not referring to anything inappropriate.

2 thrilled to go through all of them.

3 Q. Let's go through them.

4 What's the first one?

5 A. Her characterization of the first

6 meeting at Mar-a-Lago.

7 Q. What part of that was an obvious

8 lie?

9 A. The characterization that she said
10 that she said she was accosted. She looked
11 like, as best as I can recall, if I met her
12 in Mar-a-Lago as she claims, she worked at
13 Mar-a-Lago, she claims, and her statement she
14 worked at Mar-a-Lago, she would have been
15 dressed as all the spa people in Mar-a-Lago
16 would have been. It would have been
17 impossible to identify her as someone other
18 than someone who worked at a spa. She made
19 many claims, she has been a bathroom
20 attendant, front of house attendant, we don't
21 know what she was, so her obvious lies are
22 her contradictory of her own personal
23 statements within that.

7 She was driven by her mother, as a matter of

14 The first, in the first piece when
15 you were talking, I believe you said and

17 characterization of the first meeting at
18 Mar-a-Lago was an obvious lie.
19 What part of that meeting was an
20 obvious lie?
21 A. By her own testimony, all her
22 various many different descriptions of what
23 she was or wasn't or where she was or wasn't,
24 they have all changed. She was either front

2 what she was, so just by her own words, one
3 doesn't know what's true and what isn't true.
4 Q. Are you saying what position she
5 said she was working in, is that what you are
6 considering the obvious lie?
7 A. I said inconsistency within her own
8 statement from everything, so in the
9 beginning it starts off with different
10 statements.

12 piece was that she was driven by her father?

14 mother.

18 your own words but the characterization of
19 how she was with Jeffrey, what about that is
20 an obvious lie?

2 A. No. I did not state that at all,
3 you are mischaracterizing my words and what I
4 said.
5 What I said was that we can all
6 agree and I think at this point there is not
7 one person in this room, however much you
8 would like her to be younger, to say she was
9 not 17 because that has been a very offensive
10 thing that you have all done. So she was 17.
11 At 17 you are allowed to be a professional
12 masseuse and as far as I'm concerned, she was
13 a professional masseuse. There is nothing
14 inappropriate or incorrect about her coming
15 at that time to give a massage. Her entire
16 characterization of her first time at the
17 house was to me an obvious lie, given it was
18 impossible for her entire story to take place
19 given I was speaking to her mother the entire
20 she was at the house.
21 Q. So it was impossible that day, that
22 first day she came and you were speaking to
23 the mother, for Virginia Roberts to have had
24 sex with Jeffrey Epstein during the time that
25 you were outside with her mother?

13 was there because as I recall, she just met
14 with Jeffrey and then left with her mother.
15 That's my recollection.

18 is that correct?
19 A. That is correct.
20 Q. So can you testify as to whether or
21 not, do you know either from Jeffrey or any

23 had sex with Jeffrey on that first day that
24 she was at the house?

2 absolutely 1000 percent that she did not have

10 didn't do during that time, I can only

9 Epstein's Palm Beach house?

12 A. Like I said, I do not have any

15 that you took pictures of nude girls?

18 A. We already covered this. Girls we
19 are not referring to -- I can only testify to
20 taking pictures of adult people and I already
21 testified they are not nude, per se. That
22 every picture that I ever took and which they
23 were very limited, always by request, the
24 people would be covered or it would be a hand

2 A. I would like to answer your
3 questions but you are not asking me a
4 question that I can answer.
5 Q. What about that is causing you
6 pause where you can't answer the question?
7 A. You are trying to trap me and
8 that's not fair, so I already testified that
9 I hire people across the board, so I would
10 hire architects, decorators, pool people,
11 exercise instructors, gardeners, cooks,
12 chefs, cleaning people. So I, in the course
13 of a very long time when I would hire people
14 I hired people to work for Jeffrey. So I'm
15 happy to testify to hiring people for every
16 possible conceivable proper job that you
17 could conceive of within the context of
18 Jeffrey's life and homes.

20 females to bring them to Jeffrey Epstein for
21 the purpose of performing massages?

2 lots of different types of people. In terms
3 of whatever -- very small part of my job,
4 Jeffrey enjoyed getting massages. I think
5 that is something we can all agree in this
6 room and within the context of that, very
7 infrequently I would go to spas and myself
8 happily receive a professional nonsexual
9 massage from a man and/or from a woman and if
10 that massage was something that I thought was
11 something that was good, I would ask if that
12 man or woman would come back and does home
13 visits. If that person said that they did,
14 they would sometimes come, from time to time,
15 not always, come back to the house to perform
16 a nonsexual professional male or female
17 massage.
18 Q. Were any of the exercise
19 instructors you hired under the age of 18?
20 A. Again, I don't hire, we've already
21 established that I don't hire people. I
22 interview people to see if they are competent
23 in the job that they do and/or whether they
24 are someone who seemed that they can do home

2 At the point where I think that

3 there is somebody that has, can be either

4 whatever the job may be, pool, gardener, chef

5 and/or exercise instructor and I think they

6 could be good at whatever it is at whatever

7 skill that they had and they did a home visit

8 which would obviously be mandatory and Mr.

9 Epstein would meet with them and decide if he
10 wanted to have whatever skill it was that he
11 would do it and then he would then either
12 have them come back or hire them.

14 that worked at the home that were under the

4 would be.
5 Q. You never interviewed or I know you
6 don't want to use the word hired, whatever
7 your role was, you brought in an exercise
8 instructor that was under the age of 18 to
9 work at the house?

13 I was responsible for was to find people who
14 had competencies in whatever area I was
15 looking for. The competencies I was looking
16 for were professional and adult.
17 Q. So there was no exercise instructor

19 New York house or the New Mexico house or the
20 USVI under the age of 18?

3 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the

5 Q. Are they under the age of 18?
6 A. We already established that you can
7 be a masseuse in Florida at age 17. That
8 does not make it inappropriate.

10 inappropriate. I'm just asking if there were
11 any exercise instructors that were under the
12 age of 18.

14 don't want to full out and say you oh she

16 year old masseuse and have it not be

19 back and say something, now we can establish
20 that Virginia was 17 but you can be a 17 year
21 old legal masseuse, but I am not aware to

18 clearly another giant falsehood.

20 wasn't she?

14 when you met her?

16 share that with you.
17 Q. If you're showing the jury, it
18 wouldn't be privileged, so is there a
19 document you have produced in this matter
20 that shows that Virginia was 17 at the time

2 moment there is such a document, just
3 hypothetically, and assuming for the

5 somewhere, if it hasn't already been

7 waiver, a future waiver of the

2 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the

3 form and foundation.

4 A. That's not how I would characterize
5 that.

6 Q. How would you characterize it?

7 A. I have testified that I'm

8 responsible for finding professional people

9 to work in the homes, age appropriate adult
10 people, so from pool attendants, to

11 gardeners, to chefs, to housekeepers, to

12 butlers, to chauffeurs and one of the

13 functions was to be able to answer the

14 telephones and in the context of finding

15 someone to answer the telephones, I did look
16 to try to find appropriate people to answer
17 the phones.

18 Q. So did you find Johanna for

19 purposes of that role?
20 A. So in the course of looking for
21 somebody to answer phones at the house,
22 Johanna was one of the people who said that
23 she was willing to answer phones.
24 Q. Did you approach her at her school

7 number, I would give it to an assistant to

19 relationship with someone between 18 and 24
20 is legal in Florida. Two persons between 16
21 and 24, Florida statute 794.05. A person 24
22 years or of age or older who engages in
23 sexual activity with a person 16 or 17 years
24 of age commits a felony in the second degree.

14 A. So that is the same subpoena that
15 Brad Edwards failed to turn up for and then I
16 think five or six months passed between -- a
17 period of time, I can't characterize it
18 exactly, a period of time passed where then
19 he resurfaced and asked for a new subpoena to
